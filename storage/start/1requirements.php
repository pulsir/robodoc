<h3>Requirements</h3>
<p>As any peice of software, Robodoc requires a few things. Before proceeding, <b>make sure you have everything listed here</b>.</p>
<p>Robodoc is written in <a href="http://php.net">PHP</a>, so you'll need a web server with PHP installed.<br> It doesn't really matter which web server
(we recommend Apache or nginx), but the PHP version should be fairly recent (as in less-than-two-years-old-should-do). Also, althought it probably won't matter,
Robodoc is only tested and developed on Linux, so we recommend using that. Other UNIX-based operating systems (such as BSD or OS X) should also work, but there
could be issues on Windows. If you encounter issues on other operating systems, please report them.</p>
<p>Make sure you have enough space for your documentation. Robodoc uses a file-based approach to storing data, rather than a database.</p>
<p><b>If you have everything listed above, you can continue :)</b></p>

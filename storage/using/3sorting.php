<h3>Sorting</h3>
<p>The first file to show up is always <code class="inline">index.php</code>, as it's used for basic category info. Articles are sorted alphabetically by their file name. If you need to sort them in a specific order, we recommend using numbers in the first place in the file name.</p>
